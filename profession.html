              <h6>October 2015 - Februar 2020</h6>
              <p>
                After my Master studies I started working at B.Braun Hungary as a software engineer. I was involved in a project which was developing kidney dialysis machine for patients with damaged kidney or kidneys.
                I was working in the display software system team, we were responsible for controlling the graphical elements, which were created by the GUI team, related to the actual working state of the machine.
                I had the following tasks:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design and develop new features for our software running on Linux, using C and supporting scripting languages (Little of shell, Perl, python) in Clean Code approach</li>
                <li>Find cause and implement solutions for application-related incidents</li>
                <li>Create and maintain SW documentation in English language</li>
                <li>Implenent unit- and integration-tests</li>
                <li>Review the code of colleagues</li>
                <li>Participate on and contribute to SW design meetings</li>

          <p>
            After four and a half years working for BBraun I had to quit my job because we decided to move to the United Kingdom.
            We moved to Leeds in the middle of March 2020.
            I was planning bit of a change in my software engineer career.
            After having experience in C programming language, it became clear to me, that although C is a powerful language, in modern software developement there are other languages that are more practical and widely used.
            Realising this, I started to learn Python, based on the book of Eric Matthes (Python Crash Course) and online courses. They gave me basic knowledge in Python.
            To widen my skills and knowledge I enrolled to a course on edx.org.
            HarwardX: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science. The C part of the course gave me a good opportunity to practice the programming abstract data structures and Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript gave me a really great introduction to web developement.
            Because of the pandemic situation right now I am struggling to find my next job.
