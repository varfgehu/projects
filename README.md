CS50 Web: Project 0:Homepage

Assignment:
Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you [...]. (copied from CS50Web Problem Set page)

Description:
I planned to have a simple, clear design of my webpage.
I created a menu bar with the Bootstrap Grid. In this way it is responsive to the screen width.
I added a picture just to make the frontpage a bit colorful, keeping it from being empty.
I also added a greeting "Welome to my webpage, thank you for visiting!". With the use of media query if the screen width is less than 900px, the greeting is changes to "Welcome to my webpage!".
I added a picture of myself and a brief description in few words.

The about page has 4 sections in it, which are clear for the first sight thanks to the Content section. With href to ids, the user can jump to the desired section. There are picture-text pair of miltestones in my life. I used Bootstrap grid in the design.

I used the same desing on my professinal page.
I wrote about my first professional job after university. Brief dscription, roles and responsibilities.
The next section is about moving to Leeds, UK and the struggling time to find a job at the time of psndemic lockdown.

Last page is about hobbies.
For each of my hobby I created an image-text pair with a solid black border. It is also responsive to the width of the screen.
