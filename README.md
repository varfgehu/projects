# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.

templates/apology.html
Error handling is implemented in it. 

templates/channel.html:
The HTML page is created with the main 4 structures in it:
- textare for received messages,
- input field for messages to send
- button to send the message
- button to leave channel
Also channel.js javascript is "included"

templates/index.html:
The HTML page is created to:
- create new channel for the user (input field and button)
- unordered list of links of the existing channels (if any)

templates/layout.html
Creating the a template for the html pages.

templates/login.html
The HTML page is created to:
- assign a username to the app user.

static/channel.js:
Script runs when a user opens a channel.
When the page is loaded:
- emit a 'join' signal
- add event listener to "Leave Channel" button, if so: emit 'left' signal, remove 'current_channel' from local storage
- add event listener to 'Channels' button on the nav bar, creating a proper way to leave the channel the same way as with the button
- add event listener to 'new_message' input field, to send message with pressing 'Enter'
- scroll down in the textarea to the bottom.
Catch 'status_update' emit from server side:
- add text to 'chat_area' from received data
- scroll down in the textarea to the bottom
- save 'current_channel' to local storage.

static/channels.js:
Script runs when a user loads the index page.
If the 'current_channel'  exists in local storage and stores relevant data, load the channel page.

static/login.js:
if login page is loaded, remove 'current_channel'from local storage.

application.py:
imports, app initialization
Creating global variables to store existing channels, logged in usernames, channel messages which is a dictionary with deques.
Route functions:
index: renders index.html, giving the list of existing channels to it.
login: GET request: renders login.html; POST request: if username is valid and not already taken, redirects user to index page
logout: removes username from the username list, clears session.
create: POST request: get the new channel name from html form (new_channel). If channel is truly new, it is appended to the existing channel list and creates a max 100 length deque in the channel messages dictionary. Then redirects user to channel/#channel_name page
channel/#channel_name:
Saves channel name to session and renders channel page, give the page the messages in attribute.

Catching socket signals:
joined: call join_room in  flask_socketio to connect user to the channel (or room). Create a message that a user has joined the channel. Emit it as 'status_update' to populate the textarea in channels.html. Add message to channel_messages to store it.

left: call leve_room in flask_socketio to disconnect user from the channel (or room). Create a message that a suer has left the channel. Emit it as 'status_update' to populate the textarea in channel.html. Add message to channel messages to store it.

submit_message:
If the 100 number of messages is not reached, prepare the message that will be inserted to the textarea.
